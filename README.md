## Features

- Responsive on all device sizes and includes interactive elements

- The first page is the home page which has the company branding and includes a "Learn More" button to link to services page. This will help users clickly navigate to specific services they're looking for.

- The second page is the about us page which includes the team member information.

- The third page is the services page which lists out all of the products/services offered by Avicon. I used the hover to bring a nice blue background over each service when a client is browsing to give it extra appeal. I also have a button included for clients to "request a quote" which will lead them to the contact page to fill out a new project request.

- The fourth page is the contact page which includes a form for customers to fill out. Form has been tested.

- The header and the footer are fixed across all pages which gives the website great consistency. Included in the footer is a contact link for clients to easily submit a new project request and also links to all of our social media platforms.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- #### First Time Visitor Goals

  1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the company.

     1. When you first enter the website you will experience a very clean home page with an easily accessibly navigation menu allowing for simple navigation between pages without confusion. The main hero image is used to not only create an interactive feeling but it also subliminally compliments the company's products and services. Within the hero image there is also a direct button titled "Learn More" directing customers to the services page. 
     2. Using large h1 header elements to indicate the main business message that we are leaders in construction innovation.
     3. The user experience here is quite simple and functional allowing the user to easily scroll and navigate to services and also find out more information in the footer which also links to the contact page for customers to quickly receive a project quote.

  2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find products/services.

     1. The site has been designed with a standardized and fixed header and footer allowing for a clean and consistent feel as well as simple navigation on the user end.
     2. Immediately on the home page users are redirected to "Learn More" which links to the services page. Across all 3 pages, except the about us page, there is a button redirecting users to fill out a project request form.
     3. On the contact page, users are encouraged to describe their project din detail which allows us to better manage expectations and align with services offered. 

  3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for customer reviews to understand what their customers think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
     1. On the home page, immediately underneath the hero image and text, we provide customer reviews to highlight the company's success and to provide proof of products/services to new users.
     2. The customer reviews section is responsive an able to be seen on devices with screen widths of 960px and more.
     3. At the bottom of every page the footer has quick links to all the social media platforms used by Avicon Projects. This makes the UX/UI experience simple and fast. 

- #### Returning Visitor Goals

  1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about products and services.

     1. It's as simple for returning visitors as it is for new users as we redirect them to the services page immediately from the home page.
     2. Our social media platforms serve as an informational tool where we highlight new project work and products and services. 

  2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the company with any questions I may have.

     1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
     2. Here they can fill out the form on the page and provide a detailed project description.
     3. The footer contains links to the company's Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page which are all avenues where we can be contacted on.
     4. Whichever social media link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
     5. Throughout the website we have links and buttons on every page redirecting users to the contact page. 

  3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find previous project work completed by the company.
     1. We provide images and previous project work examples across all of our social media platforms.
     2. Alternatively, users can request design samples from us as a part of our services in which we will provide more information and imagery to help customers feel more confident in our work.

- #### Frequent User Goals

  1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added products or services.

     1. Products and services will be added to the services page and any newly added products will be listed.

  2. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up and follow all social media accounts to stay informed about company updates.

     1. Our footer and socila media links are really helpful in redirecting customers and users to our external social pages in which they will be able to sign up and follow our progress. 
     2. This also allows for less confusion on the website with less text and more conscise information which for the industry we're in is a key component.
